### Bike Share Project

### Description
I made use of python in order to explore data realations of the bike sharing system of three cities in the U.S (New York City, Chicago and Washington). 
A script was written in order to take in raw input from users and interpate the users input. Then the script returns data that the user wants to see.
### Function
The user first picks the specific filters that will be applied to the data the user is able to chose as many filters as they want or no filters at all.

The database will then sport the infomation based on the filters chosen.

The user can then chose to view the raw data after the origional information is provided.
### Files used
The files used for running this script are: 

washington.csv

new_york_city.csv 

and chicago.csv
